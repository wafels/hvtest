Helioviewer Background Creation
(Updated 2011/01/12)

Note: The original background was created much earlier but I never wrote down the steps I used to create the image, or
saved a layered version of the image. This document attempt to replicate the steps with some slight modifications so that
the bottom edge of the image seemless blends with a solid color (better for larger displays).

Using GIMP:

Create the gradient

  1) Create a 1200x40 RGB image.
  2) Select foreground color: #191922, and Background color ~ #f2fdff
  3) Using gradient tool, drag from the bottom edge to -50px ABOVE the top edge.
  4) Apply HSV Noise filter (2, 3, 10, 10)

Soften the transition at the bottom of the image:

  1) Zoom in and use smudge/blur tools to gradually smooth out last ~5px (burn could work, but it would darken the end of the image so a different BG color would need to be used later on)
     Try using several iterations, each at increasing opacities (e.g. 40, 60, 80)
