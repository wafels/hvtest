Helioviewer.org 2.3.0
======================

Helioviewer.org 2.3.0 is an major release focusing back-end improvements,
reuse, and the movie generation experience. Support has been added for
embedding Helioviewer.org into third-party websites, and JSONP support makes
it easier for new versions of the front-end to be created which interact
with the main Helioviewer.org back-end. Similarly, the front-end has been
rewritten to allow for easier creation of custom front-end clients without
having to reimplement a tiling system, etc.

The back-end queueing system (Helioqueuer) has been ported from Ruby to PHP
to allow for better integration with the rest of the back-end, and the movies
table structure has been modified for improved time estimation and similarity
searching. Additional options (frame-rate and movie length) are offered to
allow users further control over the movies they create and the duration
option has been moved to a more obvious location.

welcome.

Helioviewer.org 2.0.0
======================
 
Helioviewer.org 2.0.0 is a major rewrite of the original version of 
Helioviewer.org including a large number of changes to both the server-side and
front-end componenets. The main difference between this version and earlier 
version of Helioviewer are the JPEG 2000 (JP2) tiling engine. While previous 
versions had very strict requirements regarding the properties of the images to
be processed (which required many images to be rescaled and padded and also
include additional derrived header information), this release is able to accept
a much wider range of images for input.

In addition to the modifications to the tiling engine, other major changes
include:

 * Modular server-side capable of running only the desired set of components.
 * Front-end rewritten entirely in jQuery.
 * Improved support for Internet Explorer (IE), Safari, Chrome, and Opera
   web browsers.
 * Better JHelioviewer integration.
 * New layout.
 * Database performance boost.
 * Easier setup and configuration including a graphical installer.
 * Easier sharing.
 * More secure.
 
This release also includes a number of bug fixes to the earlier version
including a long-standing tiling bug which would occasionally result in missing
tiles.
